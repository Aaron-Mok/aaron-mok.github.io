      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/aaronmok.github.io/img/blog/Mouse3Drender.gif&#34; alt=&#34;DEEPscope Animation&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In neuroscience research, imaging neuronal activity in the deep brain is crucial for understanding neurological diseases. However, as imaging depth increases, the field of view usually decreases exponentially. We have improved the fluorescence signal generation efficiency of three-photon microscopy, achieving an imaging field two order of magnitudes larger than traditional three-photon microscopes in deep brain regions with cellular resolution.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Although traditional three-photon microscopes have the capability for deep imaging, their field of view is relatively small. This limitation arises because laser power must be increased with imaging depth, but excessively high laser power can raise the temperature of biological tissue, causing thermal damage. Reducing the field of view lowers the required laser power, thus minimizing the risk of thermal damage.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
